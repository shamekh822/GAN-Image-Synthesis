GAN-Image-Synthesis

This project implements GANs, including a basic MNIST-based generator, to generate realistic images of handwritten digits. It also explores latent space interpolation, vector arithmetic on generated images, and image-to-image translation using CycleGANs.

Features
•	MNIST GAN: Generates handwritten digits.
•	Latent Space Interpolation: Transitions smoothly between generated images.
•	Vector Arithmetic in Latent Space: Combines features of different digits.
•	CycleGAN for Image Translation: Transforms images between horses and zebras.
•	Experimentation: Analyzes dataset size and loss function effects.

Technologies Used
•	PyTorch, Torchvision
•	NumPy, Matplotlib
•	tqdm (for progress bars)
